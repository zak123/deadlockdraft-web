for development
```npm i && npm run dev```


to build static site
```npm i && npm run build```

feel free to PR any features you'd like to see, some I have thought of

- ~Undo button~
- ~Better UI~
- ~Copy paste results~
- ~Responsive~
- Multiplayer (Two captains join a session and take turns picking)
- Auto ban phases
- Discord webhook setting that posts the teams to a channel when draft is done


I want to keep this web app as simple as possible, and will keep ads and account logins off of this project.

runs CI on every commit to master and deploys to deadlockdraft.com
