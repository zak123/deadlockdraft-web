for development
```npm i && npm run dev```


to build static site
```npm i && npm run build```

feel free to PR any features you'd like to see, some I have thought of

- Discord webhook setting that posts the teams to a channel when draft is done
- Undo button
- Better UI, maybe mimicking the game somehow in a thematic, but simple way
- Auto ban phases

I want to keep this web app as simple as possible so I want to avoid forcing anyone to interact with the site other than 1 person managing the 12 man.

runs CI on every commit to master and deploys to deadlockdraft.com
